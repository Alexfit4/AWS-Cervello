          The development of hypersonic weapons and other emerging technologies,
          i.e., directed energy, offensive and defensive capabilities, sensors,
          etc., is meant to enhance United States national security while
          keeping pace with foreign competitors. The U.S. military is currently
          the leader in developing many of these technologies and relies on
          technological superiority in order to remain a dominant force
          worldwide. In 2018, National Defense Strategy noted that U.S. national
          security will likely be “affected by rapid technological advancements
          and the changing character of war…. New technologies include advanced
          computing, “big data” analytics, artificial intelligence, autonomy,
          robotics, directed energy, hypersonic, and biotechnology—the very
          technologies that ensure we will be able to fight and win the wars of
          the future.”  ​

          Since 2018 with the start of the Joint-Hypersonic Strike Planning and
          Execution Command and Control (J-HyperSPEC2) Joint Feasibility Study
          (JFS), Cervello has provided engineering, test and analysis services
          to USSTRATCOM.  The highly successful JT addressed Command and Control
          (C2), Hypersonic Concept of Operations (CONOPS), including
          authorities, planning, and force management for hypersonic weapons.

          Currently, contractors provide subject matter expertise in the areas
          of Hypersonic Strike Weapon (HSW) C2, Hypersonic CONOPS, and
          Hypersonic Modeling and Simulation writing a Department of Defense
          (DoD) level Operational HSW CONOPS for USSTRATCOM J8 Capabilities and
          Resource Integration and J3 Global Operations.
