            The Applied Sciences Division develops and applies a fast, agile,
            and robust methodology to accomplish Operational Assessments on
            emerging capabilities and Quick Reaction Tests (QRT) on Tactics,
            Techniques, and Procedures (TTP).  ​

            The Applied Sciences Division’s objective is to research innovative
            new war-game scenarios, experiments, and table top exercises that can
            be used by military and government entities, components, and
            stakeholders to analyze issues across mission areas. An additional
            objective is to make recommendations in support of devising and
            acquiring a comprehensive suite of modeling and simulation
            capabilities to enhance the ability to efficiently and effectively
            plan and execute operations and advocate for capabilities as
            directed by authoritative guidance.

          <p>
            Modeling and simulation (M&S) capabilities will be used to support
            strategic analysis of current and future capabilities; war-games and
            experimentation; and analysis and recommendations for development of
            improved Concept of Operations, tactics, techniques and procedures,
            and technology road-maps. These activities will identify gaps in
            mission capabilities or explore options to address identified
            capability shortfalls. These capabilities provide opportunities to
            define and refine mission-related policies, tactics, techniques, and
            procedures, organizational constructs, and effectiveness of
            operational tools throughout the community of interest.
